source get dest version checksums, make diff based on dest per-block checksums
send diff plus SHA of source copy

(if mthread, have several source starting points, one per thread)

dest applies diffs(*), computes own instance of SHA and checks against source
dest receives and writes source per-block computed checksums(++)

(IDEA:
src->dest rolling checksum per block
dest->src SHA checksum per block (++)
)

---save bytes
dest process to apply : receive diff (contents part of diff can be via objects in btree)
'same' part offsets can be via xmlrpc

wrapping writer class compute block SHA chksums on dest side


dot-files in catalog, or metadata, can be used to hold block checksum data
(ensure when walking as a source, to skip copying these.)
